/*
Redo Listing 7.7, modifying the three array-handling functions to each use two
pointer parameters to represent a range.The fill_array() function, instead of
returning the actual number of items read, should return a pointer to the location
after the last location filled; the other functions can use this pointer as the second
argument to identify the end of the data.
